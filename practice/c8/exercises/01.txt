Q: We discussed using the expression sizeof(a) / size of(a[0]) to calculate the number of elements in an array. 
The expression sizeof(a) / sizeof(t), where t is the type of a's elements, would also work, but itâ€™s considered an inferior technique.
Why?

A: If we wanted to change the type of elements that the array can store,
then we would have to rewrite the expression sizeof(a) / sizeof(t), 
since sizeof(t) would be refering to the old element type.

With sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]) we don't have to rewrite anything 
once we change the type of elements that the array can store
